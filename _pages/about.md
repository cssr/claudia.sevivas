I'm currently the coordinator of the bachelor degree of Game Development at IADE - Creative University.

<h4> RESEARCH INTERESTS</h4> 
My work revolves around leveraging technologies like Serious Games and Virtual Worlds, Multimodal Interaction and Visualization, and Machine Learning and Image Processing. I'm particularly interested in utilizing these tools to enhance learning experiences, create immersive environments, and analyze complex datasets. Additionally, I delve into the realm of VJing, Live Painting, and Video Art, exploring the intersection between digital and analog mediums to create innovative artistic expressions. Moreover, I design and implement Interactive Installations, aiming to engage audiences in interactive experiences that blur the boundaries between art and technology. Through these endeavors, I aim to contribute to the advancement of interdisciplinary research and the exploration of novel applications in various domains.
