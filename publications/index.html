Traditionally, a driving goal of digital storytelling is the generation of dramatic stories with human significance, but for learning purposes, the need for drama is complemented by the requirement of achieving particular learning outcomes. This paper presents a narrative engine that supports emergent storytelling to support the development of complex competences in the learning domains of project management and innovation. The approach is based on the adaptation on the Fabula model combined with cases representing situated contexts associated to particular competences. These cases are then triggered to influence the unfolding of the story such that a learner encounters dramatic points in the narrative where the associated competences need to be used. In addition to the description of the approach and corresponding narrative engine, an illustration is presented of how the competence “conflict management” influences a story.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr></div> <div id="10.1007/978-3-642-23834-5_11" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Use of Integrative Framework to Support the Development of Competences</div> <div class="author">Fradinho Oliveira, Manuel, Andersen, Bjorn, Pereira, Joao, Seager, William, and Ribeiro, Claudia </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Serious Games Development and Applications</em> 2011, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23834-5_11" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In corporate environments, there is a growing interest in deploying more effective solutions in supporting competence development, namely to address the identified need of developing soft-skills (eg: negotiation, leadership) and complex competences (eg: sense-making and cross-cultural communication). The “learning by doing” has gained prominence, in particular when considering the use of serious games as the delivery platform for the educational content. However, the adoption of serious games alone is not a guarantee for effective learning and consequently, the aim of this paper is to present the integrative framework that combines together five key developments in education research, namely Knowledge Ecology, Social Learning Communities, Threshold Concepts, Experience Management and Cognitive Management.

Consequently, contemporary organizational thinking has evolved to embrace paradigms supported by complexity theory and its principles. Complexity theory involves the study of many actors and their interactions. One of the central topics regarding interaction between self-interested agents is cooperation. Cooperation is crucial for societies and organizations, since it allows the creation of common goods that no single individual could establish alone. However, this situation itself presents a dilemma, because as the creation of these goods requires an individual effort and the result is shared by everyone, there is the temptation to make an individual contribution as little as possible and receive as much of the result as one can. The problem of how can cooperation emerge in a organization of self-interested individuals is one of the central questions addressed by social sciences, game theory, political science and behavioural and evolutionary economics. The study of large number of actors with changing patterns of interaction often gets too difficult for a mathematical solution, therefore other type of solutions need to be used. A primary research tool of complexity theory is computer simulation. The basic underlying function of this tool is to specify how the agents interact, and then observe properties that occur at the level of the whole organization. The simulation of agents and their interactions is known as agent-based modelling (ABM) (Miller and Page 2007). Although agent-based modelling employs simulation, it does not aim to provide an accurate representation of a particular empirical application (Axelrod 1997). Instead, the goal of agent-based modelling is to enrich our understanding of fundamental processes that may appear in a variety of applications. This is the assumptions underlying the proposal described in this paper. To represent the functioning of an organization DEMO’s Ψ-theory (Dietz 2006) was used. The Ψ-theory explains how and why people cooperate and communicate. It postulates that the operation of an organization can be expressed by a specification of the commitments that the organizational subjects enter into and comply with. Based on this theory and concepts developed in Game Theory this paper proposes a agent-based simulation with an underlying conceptual model that allows to experiment and analyse the different patterns that emerge when organizational subjects use different kind of strategies to handle commitments to produce organizational output.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="simultech12" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A General Process for Developing Business Simulations Games</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Borbinha, José, Pereira, João, and Tribolet, José </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Simulation and Modeling Methodologies, Technologies and Applications - SIMULTECH,</em> 2012, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5220/0004061001900193" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/business_simulation_games.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Nowadays people, groups and organizations are increasingly confronted with problems and situations that show an increasing level of complexity. However, human abilities to deal with complex dynamic systems and processes, while behaving in a sustainable way, have not improved to the required extent. One way to deal with complex situation is the simulation approach: build a simplified model of this reality, learn from this simplified model, and, finally, translate the findings or knowledge back to reality. Simulation games are based on this idea. Nevertheless, if we want to make inferences about reality based on experiences and knowledge acquired in a simulation game, we have to be sure that the underlying conceptual model is a good, or valid, representation of the real situation. Based on knowledge gather from the simulation development process and Agent-based Modelling, this paper proposes a general process for developing business simulation games.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Elsevier</abbr></div> <div id="fernandes2012ithink" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">iThink: A game-based approach towards improving collaboration and participation in requirement elicitation</div> <div class="author">Fernandes, João, Duarte, Diogo, Ribeiro, Claudia, Farinha, Carla, Pereira, João Madeiras, and Silva, Miguel Mira </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Procedia Computer Science</em> 2012, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2012.10.059" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/iThink_fernandes2012.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Requirements are the heart of Information Systems development because they determine how the system will operate.

In this article we present a game-based collaborative tool called iThink that aims at improving the participation in a requirement elicitation process. iThink takes advantage of the associa- tion between “gamification” concepts and the six hats of thinking method for collecting both new requirements and feedback about existing ones and for presenting the requirement elicitation process in a form of a collaborative game.

They act as serious games which contribute to learning through a simulation of real-life situations and business environments. They are especially useful in the area of business management processes and business strategies. The blending of designed simulation technology and content curricula offers participants (players, students) a risk-free opportunity to test out a range of relevant strategies to drive business results. By customizing computer-based business simulations, participants can integrate key strategic and financial priorities. This paper provides a brief review of business simulations that serve learning purposes. The first part presents a short introduction and description of business games and their evaluation properties, and the second part provides a brief evaluation and analysis of selected business simulation games.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2013</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IGI Global</abbr></div> <div id="ribeiro2015" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Challenges of Introducting Serious Games and Virtual Worlds in Educational Curriculum.</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Pereira, João, Calado, C., and Ferreira, C. </div> <div class="periodical"> 2013, </div> <div class="links"> <a href="https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-4666-2848-9.ch022" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr></div> <div id="10.1007/978-3-642-40814-4_46" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Creating Awareness of Emergency Departments Healthcare Values Using a Serious Game</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Pereira, João, and Borbinha, José </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Scaling up Learning for Sustained Impact</em> 2013, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40814-4_46" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The world in which medicine and healthcare institutions are managed is rapidly changing in complex and unpredictable ways.

Healthcare professionals face a life- time challenge in medical education right from the beginning of medical school. They experience serious difficulties to keep updated. Traditional adult education, largely used in medical training, shows little effectiveness. Problem-based-learning has been proposed as a student-centred pedagogy to overcome failure of traditional medical instruction. A more recent trend is related to the use of serious games. Although, there are still few examples of serious games for medical education, the increased interest shown in the latest years shows that this is an important area and with a lot of potential to explore. In this paper we present the serious game Critical Transport, targeted at medical students with the aim to teach and train the recommendations for the transport of critically ill patients. This game was designed and validated with physicians of an academic hospital and tested during a formal class.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2014</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr></div> <div id="10.1007/978-3-662-43454-3_5" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Didactical Competence Modeller: Dynamic Story Creation for Serious Games</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Fernandes, João, and Pereira, João </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In New Horizons in Web Based Learning</em> 2014, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-43454-3_5" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Traditionally, a driving goal of digital storytelling is the generation of dramatic stories with human significance, but for learning purposes, the need for drama is complemented by the requirement of achieving particular learning outcomes. This paper presents an interactive storytelling conceptual framework that supports the dynamic creation of stories based on predefined pedagogical goals. The approach is based on a hierarchical structure of plot pieces, denominated Narrative Building Blocks which, represent the elements that convey the story context as well as the roles and behaviours of each actor.

In order to undermine its potential threat and effect on patients, a medical decision protocol based on evidence was developed to help healthcare professionals to both identify as well as treat these patients in a timely manner. Keeping updated with the algorithm guidelines implies healthcare professionals attending workshop classes, which further complicates the management of resources in an Emergency Department. In this paper we describe the Sepsis Fast Track serious game aimed at teaching healthcare professionals the Sepsis Fast Track guidelines. A set of game mechanics where proposed and developed in order to integrate the guidelines pedagogical goals in the sepsis fast track serious game’s gameplay cycle.

A trace is a history of users’ actions collected in real-time during their inter-action with a computer system. The process of identifying the level of engagement consists of transforming low-level behaviours (e.g. clicks) in contextualized high-level behaviours. The proposed approach is exemplified by applying it to the identification of engaged-behaviours in a serious game for training clinical procedures on sepsis treatment protocol. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IEEE</abbr></div> <div id="7296095" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">SeGTE: A serious game to train and evaluate basic life support</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Tiago, Joana, Monteiro, Micaela, and Pereira, João </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In 2014 International Conference on Computer Graphics Theory and Applications (GRAPP)</em> 2014, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7296095" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/SeGTE_A_serious_game_to_train_and_evaluate_basic_life_support.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Basic life support (BLS) is the level of medical care which is used for victims of life-threatening illnesses or injuries until they can be given full medical care at a hospital. It can be provided by trained medical personnel, including emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and by laypersons who have received BLS training. BLS is generally used in the pre-hospital setting, and can be provided without medical equipment. The ability to respond to an emergency situation can be the difference between life and death. Acknowledging this fact has made decision-makers, governments and Non Government Organizations (NGO) to make a priority to spread this knowledge and skills to the general population. Currently, BLS is taught in a standard course provided by the Red Course or certified entities, where the pedagogical content given to the students is a mix of theoretical and practical training where life-size mannequin are used. In this paper we argue that serious games could help spread this knowledge through the general population and it could also be used to refresh the knowledge of people that have been certified in BLS in the past. In order to test this hypothesis we have developed the SeGTE game and performed an evaluation of its effectiveness on conveying such pedagogical content.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IGI Global</abbr></div> <div id="ribeiro2014critical" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Critical Transport: A Serious Game to Teach the Recommendations for the Transport of Critically Ill Patients</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Antunes, Tiago, Pereira, João, and Monteiro, Micaela </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Journal of Game-Based Learning (IJGBL)</em> 2014, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.irma-international.org/article/critical-transport/121795/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/critical_transport_journal.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>At present, medical knowledge is experiencing an exponential growth.

Before requirements can be analyzed, modeled, or specified they must be gathered through an elicitation process. Requirements elicitation is non-trivial because you can never be sure you get all requirements from the user or stakeholder by just asking them what the system should do. Requirements elicitation practices include interviews, questionnaires, user observation, workshops, brainstorming, use cases, role playing and prototyping. However, these common procedures are still prone to be ambiguous or incorrect which can lead the Information Systems to failure. It is consensual that one of the major problem of this activity relates to the communication and collaboration between different and distant stakeholders. Thus, recent studies have been proposing web collaborative tools to gather these stakeholders in order to elicit requirements. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptance of such a collaborative tool which was developed by using a gamification approach and the Six Thinking Hats method.

It requires fast diagnosis and treatment, since the survival rate decreases 7.6% for every hour without treatment. In order to facilitate this process of diagnosis and medical therapy, the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health issued a document regulating the implementation of a Sepsis Fast Track protocol based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Training of emergency department healthcare professionals is essential, and should be attended regularly in order to refresh knowledge and to be made aware of updates to any changes of the protocol. Currently, this training is conducted through traditional learning methods often considered as outdated for the younger generation, the so-called "digital natives". The usage of serious games is a trend that has been considered when discussing new tools for teaching and training in various fields, including healthcare. Several research works on the impact of applying such technologies in healthcare, stating that serious games could provide new approaches and opportunities have been published. This paper presents the Sepsis Fast Track serious game. It is a serious game developed to teach and train nurses and physicians working in hospital Emergency Departments on the Sepsis Fast Track protocol. An evaluation study carried out with the healthcare professionals is also presented. The main goal of which was to evaluate the impact of serious games on professional working practices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="xcoax" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Visualization Techniques as Methodological Tools for Dance Research</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, and Evola, Vito </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Computation, Communication, Aesthetics &amp; X</em> 2017, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="http://2017.xcoax.org/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/xcoax.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Dance Research is a term that refers to the methods and methodological approaches used in dance studies, a relatively new academic discipline.

This acknowledgement reflects the importance of preserving the knowledge generated within this art form for future generations. Nevertheless, what and how this sensible material should be preserved is still lacking clear methodological approaches. When considering creative processes, this seems an even more daunting task, as it goes beyond simply documenting the final product of a creation. Recent advancements in technology has allowed to consider other approaches of capturing data apart from video or photography, which are mostly static and have a single viewpoint. In this paper we describe how 3D data capture and point cloud visualization techniques have been used to capture and document João Fiadeiro’s choreographic and compositional processes. Together with Fiadeiro we have identified a sub-set of core concepts of his method which have then been used to conduct two improvisation sessions involving Fiadeiro’s dancers and himself. Those concepts have been used as the basis for the development of new visualization techniques that better illustrate, in an interactive system, the complexity of Fiadeiro’s creative process.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr></div> <div id="dos2018stroke" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Stroke-based splatting: an efficient multi-resolution point cloud visualization technique</div> <div class="author">Anjos, Rafael Kuffner, Ribeiro, Claudia Sofia, Lopes, Daniel Simões, and Pereira, João Madeiras </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The Visual Computer</em> 2018, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-017-1420-7" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/Anjos2018_Article_Stroke-basedSplattingAnEfficie.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Current state-of-the-art point cloud visualization techniques have shortcomings when dealing with sparse and less accurate data or close-up interactions. In this paper, we present a visualization technique called stroke-based splatting, which applies concepts of stroke-based rendering to surface-aligned splatting, allowing for better shape perception at lower resolutions and close-ups. We create a painterly depiction of the data with an impressionistic aesthetic, which is a metaphor the user is culturally trained to recognize, thus attributing higher quality to the visualization. This is achieved by shaping each object-aligned splat as a brush stroke, and orienting it according to globally coherent tangent vectors from the Householder formula, creating a painterly depiction of the scanned cloud. Each splat is sized according to a color-based clustering analysis of the data, ensuring the consistency of brush strokes within neighborhood areas. By controlling brush shape generation parameters and blending factors between neighboring splats, the user is able to simulate different painting styles in real time. We have tested our method with data sets captured by commodity laser scanners as well as publicly available high-resolution point clouds, both having highly interactive frame rates in all cases. In addition, a user study was conducted comparing our approach to state-of-the-art point cloud visualization techniques. Users considered stroke-based splatting a valuable technique as it provides a higher or similar visual quality to current approaches.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Springer</abbr></div> <div id="Ribeiro2018" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Virtual Reality Annotator: A Tool to Annotate Dancers in a Virtual Environment</div> <div class="author">Ribeiro, Claudia, Kuffner, Rafael, and Fernandes, Carla </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Digital Cultural Heritage: Final Conference of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Initial Training Network for Digital Cultural Heritage, ITN-DCH 2017, Olimje, Slovenia, May 23–25, 2017, Revised Selected Papers</em> 2018, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75826-8_21" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/ribeiro2018.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>In this paper we describe the Virtual Reality Annotator, a visualization tool that allows users to dynamically annotate dancers in a virtual reality environment.

Indeed, identifying movement qualities with the intention of co-relating them to specific meanings and choreographic intentions is practically impossible without taking an artist-driven approach. Moreover, equipping dancers with wearable technology in order to accurately track each of their movements is only applicable in controlled laboratory scenarios, therefore not being a viable approach to analyze large scale real-world rehearsals or performances. This paper describes a visualization system that exposes movement qualities for dance through rendering effects. Combining optical flow analysis with depth video information, we were able to estimate the three-dimensional flow for each point in the cloud. This information was used to color point cloud videos with this information, showing potential to be used for the creation of different rendering effects, which are also discussed in this paper. The data used was captured in a non-intrusive manner during the creation process of a dance piece by Portuguese choreographer Rui Lopes Graça, enabling us to examine nuances and details of the rehearsals’ process, which would not be replicable in a laboratory environment.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Emerald</abbr></div> <div id="carreira2018virtual" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Virtual reality as integration environments for facilities management: Application and users perception</div> <div class="author">Carreira, Paulo, Castelo, Tiago, Gomes, Cristina Caramelo, Ferreira, Alfredo, Ribeiro, Claudia, and Costa, Antonio Aguiar </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Engineering, Construction and Architectural Management</em> 2018, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ECAM-09-2016-0198/full/html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of virtual reality environments (VRE) for maintenance activities by augmenting a virtual facility representation and integrating relevant information regarding the status of systems and the space itself, while providing simple ways to control them.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">VISIGRAPP</abbr></div> <div id="nunes2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Emotional and Engaging Movie Annotation with Gamification</div> <div class="author">Nunes, Lino, Ribeiro, Claudia, and Chambel, Teresa </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 17th International Joint Conference on Computer Vision, Imaging and Computer Graphics Theory and Applications - Volume 2: HUCAPP</em> 2022, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2022/109915/pdf/index.html" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/claudia.sevivas/assets/pdf/lino_nunes_2022.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Entertainment has always been present in human activities, satisfying needs and playing a role in the lives of individuals and communities. In particular, movies have a strong emotional impact on us, with their rich multimedia content and their stories; while games tend to defy and engage us facing challenges and hopefully achieving rewarding experiences and results. In this paper, we present a web application being designed and developed to access movies based on emotional impact, with the focus on the emotional annotation of movies, using different emotional representations, and gamification elements to further engage users in this task, beyond their intrinsic motivation. These annotations can help enriching emotional classification of movies and their impact on users, with machine learning approaches, later helping to find movies based on this impact; and they can also be collected as personal notes like on a journal where users collect the movies they treasure the most, and that they can review and even compare along their journey. We also present a preliminary user evaluation, allowing to assess and learn about its perceived utility, usability and user experience, and to identify most promising features and directions for further improvements and developments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Routledge</abbr></div> <div id="fcshbook" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dance Data, Cognition and Multimodal Communication</div> <div class="author">Fernandes, Carla, Evola, Vito, and Ribeiro, Claudia </div> <div class="periodical"> 2022, </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Dance-Data-Cognition-and-Multimodal-Communication/Fernandes-Evola-Ribeiro/p/book/9780367617455" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Dance Data, Cognition, and Multimodal Communication is the result of a collaborative and transdisciplinary effort towards a first definition of "dance data", with its complexities and contradictions, in a time where cognitive science is growing in parallel to the need of a renewed awareness of the body’s agency in our manyfold interactions with the world. It is a reflection on the observation of bodily movements in artistic settings, and one that views human social interactions, multimodal communication, and cognitive processes through a different lens—that of the close collaboration between performing artists, designers, and scholars. This collection focuses simultaneously on methods and technologies for creating, documenting, or representing dance data. The editors highlight works focusing on the dancers’ embodied minds, including research using neural, cognitive, behavioural, and linguistic data in the context of dance composition processes. Each chapter deals with dance data from an interdisciplinary perspective, presenting theoretical and methodological discussions emerging from empirical studies, as well as more experimental ones. The book, which includes digital Support Material on the volume’s Routledge website, will be of great interest to students and scholars in contemporary dance, neuro-cognitive science, intangible cultural heritage, performing arts, cognitive linguistics, embodiment, design, new media, and creativity studies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">IEEE</abbr></div> <div id="Alarcao2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Annotate Smarter, Not Harder: Using Active Learning to Reduce Emotional Annotation Effort</div> <div class="author">Alarcão, M.

Although millions of images are presently available, only a few are annotated with reliable emotional information. Current solutions either use large amounts of weakly-labeled web images, which often contain noise that is unrelated to the emotions of the image, or transfer learning, which usually results in performance losses. Thus, it would be desirable to know which images would be useful to be annotated to avoid an extensive annotation effort. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to choose which images are more relevant to be annotated by humans using active and online learning. Our approach dynamically combines multiple active learning strategies and learns the best ones (without prior knowledge of which ones would be the best). Experiments using nine benchmark datasets revealed that: (i) both the best individual strategies and our combination achieved a performance very similar to the baseline, and in most cases even surpassed it (using on average only 33% of the number of images used by the baseline); (ii) our combination of strategies successfully and quickly converges to the performance of the best individual strategy without any annotation effort and experimentation overhead.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">Elsevier</abbr></div> <div id="Alarcao2022a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Unfolding Handcrafted Features Contribution in CNNs for Valence and Arousal Estimation in Images</div> <div class="author">Alarcão, M.

Thus, being able to automatically assess the emotional impact an image will have on viewers can be useful in numerous applications. Affective Image Content Analysis (AICA) has gained increasing attention over the past few decades. While the first approaches relied on handcrafted visual features to attribute an emotional classification to an image, more recent works explore features learned using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to leverage the performance achieved in object classification in the context of AICA. Although the use of either handcrafted and deep features has achieved promising results, it has not yet been possible to attain human-level performance. In this paper, we shed some light on the impact of combining handcrafted with learned features for the estimation of valence and arousal values. First, we identified 30 discriminant handcrafted visual and semantic features for the estimation of valence and arousal using statistical analysis. Then, we analysed the impact of using the discriminant handcrafted features on three well-known CNN architectures (VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50) using transfer learning, and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Experiments conducted on nine benchmark datasets revealed that the use of color and semantic information with the ResNet50 has yielded promising results for valence. For arousal, deep features from the ResNet50 achieved better results than its combination with the handcrafted features. The MLP achieved superior results than the ResNet50 for both valence and arousal using only one semantic feature.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Claudia Sevivas.
