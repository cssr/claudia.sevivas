description: Cláudia Ribeiro, in collaboration with Michaela Honauer, has created the video “Memories”, based on Milan Kundera’s idea that gestures inhabit people. Using 3D data captured with multiple Kinect sensors from Rui Lopes Graça latest piece “Quinze Bailarinos e Tempo Incerto”, and video data capture during the Choreographic Coding Lab, they have explored the dichotomy between ballet movements and contemporary dance movements.

BlackBox Post-Doc researcher Cláudia Ribeiro has participated in the 8th Choreographic Coding Lab, an interdisciplinary event that promotes a collaborative work mixing contemporary dance and the digital media.
The event took place from May 6th to 11th as part of the Fiber Festival in Amsterdam, and gathered dancers, choreographers and artists working with code and digital media.
Cláudia Ribeiro, in collaboration with Michaela Honauer, has created the video “Memories”, based on Milan Kundera’s idea that gestures inhabit people. Using 3D data captured with multiple Kinect sensors from Rui Lopes Graça latest piece “Quinze Bailarinos e Tempo Incerto”, and video data capture during the Choreographic Coding Lab, they have explored the dichotomy between ballet movements and contemporary dance movements. They used generative art superimposed to neo-classical ballet dancers with a view to enhance the structured nature of this dance genre.
In the video, three desynchronized versions of the same dancer performing the same sequence are shown simultaneously, this causing the impression that we are observing different dancers, as if the same gestures would remind us of different people/individuals. In the background we see a fainted video of two contemporary dancers improvising a set of movements yet to become part of our memory of this dance genre. The overlap between the two images is used to enhance what already is and what will become.
The final video can be watched here:
