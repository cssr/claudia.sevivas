ApiarioVR was a project developed by Oskar&Gapar(https://oskargaspar.com/) focused on creating an environment where users can experience and learn about bees, their environment and their role in pollination . It consisted in four different virtual reality scenarios, namely a forest, a farm, an orchard, and a city. In each scenario a user is invited to answer to questionnaires and interact with different virtual objects. This project was develop in Unity3D for the facebook oculus quest 2. In this project I was reponsible for optimizing 3D object rendering and implementing the navigation and interaction.
