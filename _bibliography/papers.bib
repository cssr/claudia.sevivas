  abstract="At present, medical knowledge is experiencing an exponential growth. This results in serious difficulties to healthcare professionals in keeping up to date. At the same time, medical education is mostly taught using traditional learning methodologies, not always the most efficient. Recently however, there has been a significant increase in the use of computer games for both teaching and training as several published studies are showing that serious games can be more efficient when compared to traditional learning methodologies. Although the current number of serious games used in medical education is still very limited, the authors agree that it's application could lead to the improvement of medical knowledge and skills. This paper describes the serious game Critical Transport which is based on the Portuguese Society of Intensive Care's recommendations for the transport of critically ill patients, as well as the results of a pre/post-test study focused in determining the Critical Transport serious game efficiency as a training tool for training medical students.",

Traditionally, a driving goal of digital storytelling is the generation of dramatic stories with human significance, but for learning purposes, the need for drama is complemented by the requirement of achieving particular learning outcomes. This paper presents a narrative engine that supports emergent storytelling to support the development of complex competences in the learning domains of project management and innovation. The approach is based on the adaptation on the Fabula model combined with cases representing situated contexts associated to particular competences. These cases are then triggered to influence the unfolding of the story such that a learner encounters dramatic points in the narrative where the associated competences need to be used. In addition to the description of the approach and corresponding narrative engine, an illustration is presented of how the competence ``conflict management'' influences a story.",

Restraining the viewpoint of the user to the recorded point of view can be an obstacle in several scenarios.

This article describes a follow-up work on the previously developed Creation-Tool [2] extending the existing functionality to tackle this problem. The developed system places the 2D annotations onto a three-dimensional point cloud, captured by depth sensors coupled with cameras around the performance, thus enabling the user to freely visualize the annotated performance three-dimensionally at an arbitrary point of view.},

  abstract = {Sepsis is a serious medical condition responsible for high levels of in-hospital mortality. It requires fast diagnosis and treatment, since the survival rate decreases 7.6% for every hour without treatment. In order to facilitate this process of diagnosis and medical therapy, the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health issued a document regulating the implementation of a Sepsis Fast Track protocol based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Training of emergency department healthcare professionals is essential, and should be attended regularly in order to refresh knowledge and to be made aware of updates to any changes of the protocol. Currently, this training is conducted through traditional learning methods often considered as outdated for the younger generation, the so-called "digital natives". The usage of serious games is a trend that has been considered when discussing new tools for teaching and training in various fields, including healthcare. Several research works on the impact of applying such technologies in healthcare, stating that serious games could provide new approaches and opportunities have been published. This paper presents the Sepsis Fast Track serious game. It is a serious game developed to teach and train nurses and physicians working in hospital Emergency Departments on the Sepsis Fast Track protocol. An evaluation study carried out with the healthcare professionals is also presented. The main goal of which was to evaluate the impact of serious games on professional working practices.},

A trace is a history of users’ actions collected in real-time

identifying the level of engagement consists of transforming
low-level behaviours (e.g. clicks) in contextualized high-level

It can be provided by trained medical personnel, including emergency medical technicians, paramedics, and by laypersons who have received BLS training. BLS is generally used in the pre-hospital setting, and can be provided without medical equipment. The ability to respond to an emergency situation can be the difference between life and death. Acknowledging this fact has made decision-makers, governments and Non Government Organizations (NGO) to make a priority to spread this knowledge and skills to the general population. Currently, BLS is taught in a standard course provided by the Red Course or certified entities, where the pedagogical content given to the students is a mix of theoretical and practical training where life-size mannequin are used. In this paper we argue that serious games could help spread this knowledge through the general population and it could also be used to refresh the knowledge of people that have been certified in BLS in the past. In order to test this hypothesis we have developed the SeGTE game and performed an evaluation of its effectiveness on conveying such pedagogical content.",

  abstract="There is no doubt around the dynamics and uncertainty characterizing organizations and their environments. Consequently, contemporary organizational thinking has evolved to embrace paradigms supported by complexity theory and its principles.
Complexity theory involves the study of many actors and their interactions. One of the central topics regarding interaction between self-interested agents is cooperation. Cooperation is crucial for societies and organizations, since it allows the creation of common goods that no single individual could establish alone. However, this situation itself presents a dilemma, because as the creation of these goods requires an individual effort and the result is shared by everyone, there is the temptation to make an individual contribution as little as possible and receive as much of the result as one can. The problem of how can cooperation emerge in a organization of self-interested individuals is one of the central questions addressed by social sciences, game theory, political science and behavioural and evolutionary economics.
The study of large number of actors with changing patterns of interaction often gets too difficult for a mathematical solution, therefore other type of solutions need to be used. A primary research tool of complexity theory is computer simulation. The basic underlying function of this tool is to specify how the agents interact, and then observe properties that occur at the level of the whole organization. The simulation of agents and their interactions is known as agent-based modelling (ABM) (Miller and Page 2007).
Although agent-based modelling employs simulation, it does not aim to provide an accurate representation of a particular empirical application (Axelrod 1997). Instead, the goal of agent-based modelling is to enrich our understanding of fundamental processes that may appear in a variety of applications. This is the assumptions underlying the proposal described in this paper. To represent the functioning of an organization DEMO's Ψ-theory (Dietz 2006) was used. The Ψ-theory explains how and why people cooperate and communicate. It postulates that the operation of an organization can be expressed by a specification of the commitments that the organizational subjects enter into and comply with. Based on this theory and concepts developed in Game Theory this paper proposes a agent-based simulation with an underlying conceptual model that allows to experiment and analyse the different patterns that emerge when organizational subjects use different kind of strategies to handle commitments to produce organizational output.",

However, human abilities to deal with complex dynamic systems and processes, while behaving in a sustainable way, have not improved to the required extent. One way to deal with complex situation is the simulation approach: build a simplified model of this reality, learn from this simplified model, and, finally, translate the findings or knowledge back to reality. Simulation games are based on this idea. Nevertheless, if we want to make inferences about reality based on experiences and knowledge acquired in a simulation game, we have to be sure that the underlying conceptual model is a good, or valid, representation of the real situation.

  abstract="Current state-of-the-art point cloud visualization techniques have shortcomings when dealing with sparse and less accurate data or close-up interactions. In this paper, we present a visualization technique called stroke-based splatting, which applies concepts of stroke-based rendering to surface-aligned splatting, allowing for better shape perception at lower resolutions and close-ups. We create a painterly depiction of the data with an impressionistic aesthetic, which is a metaphor the user is culturally trained to recognize, thus attributing higher quality to the visualization. This is achieved by shaping each object-aligned splat as a brush stroke, and orienting it according to globally coherent tangent vectors from the Householder formula, creating a painterly depiction of the scanned cloud. Each splat is sized according to a color-based clustering analysis of the data, ensuring the consistency of brush strokes within neighborhood areas. By controlling brush shape generation parameters and blending factors between neighboring splats, the user is able to simulate different painting styles in real time. We have tested our method with data sets captured by commodity laser scanners as well as publicly available high-resolution point clouds, both having highly interactive frame rates in all cases. In addition, a user study was conducted comparing our approach to state-of-the-art point cloud visualization techniques. Users considered stroke-based splatting a valuable technique as it provides a higher or similar visual quality to current approaches.",

  abstract="At present, medical knowledge is experiencing an exponential growth. This results in serious difficulties to healthcare professionals in keeping up to date. At the same time, medical education is mostly taught using traditional learning methodologies, not always the most efficient. Recently however, there has been a significant increase in the use of computer games for both teaching and training as several published studies are showing that serious games can be more efficient when compared to traditional learning methodologies. Although the current number of serious games used in medical education is still very limited, the authors agree that it's application could lead to the improvement of medical knowledge and skills. This paper describes the serious game Critical Transport which is based on the Portuguese Society of Intensive Care's recommendations for the transport of critically ill patients, as well as the results of a pre/post-test study focused in determining the Critical Transport serious game efficiency as a training tool for training medical students.",

  abstract="The requirements engineering process is a key phase of the Information System development since it determines its functionalities and its operation. Before requirements can be analyzed, modeled, or specified they must be gathered through an elicitation process. Requirements elicitation is non-trivial because you can never be sure you get all requirements from the user or stakeholder by just asking them what the system should do. Requirements elicitation practices include interviews, questionnaires, user observation, workshops, brainstorming, use cases, role playing and prototyping. However, these common procedures are still prone to be ambiguous or incorrect which can lead the Information Systems to failure. It is consensual that one of the major problem of this activity relates to the communication and collaboration between different and distant stakeholders. Thus, recent studies have been proposing web collaborative tools to gather these stakeholders in order to elicit requirements. The paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptance of such a collaborative tool which was developed by using a gamification approach and the Six Thinking Hats method. The document also makes a discussion of the implication and outcomes of improving stakeholders collaboration.",

  abstract="The performing arts, and dance in particular, have been considered as intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO since 2003. This acknowledgement reflects the importance of preserving the knowledge generated within this art form for future generations. Nevertheless, what and how this sensible material should be preserved is still lacking clear methodological approaches. When considering creative processes, this seems an even more daunting task, as it goes beyond simply documenting the final product of a creation. Recent advancements in technology has allowed to consider other approaches of capturing data apart from video or photography, which are mostly static and have a single viewpoint. In this paper we describe how 3D data capture and point cloud visualization techniques have been used to capture and document João Fiadeiro's choreographic and compositional processes. Together with Fiadeiro we have identified a sub-set of core concepts of his method which have then been used to conduct two improvisation sessions involving Fiadeiro's dancers and himself. Those concepts have been used as the basis for the development of new visualization techniques that better illustrate, in an interactive system, the complexity of Fiadeiro's creative process.",

  booktitle={Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Movement and Computing},
  pages={1--7},
  abstract="Analyzing and documenting contemporary dance movement data has proven to be a very difficult task due to the vast existence of styles and aesthetics which are characteristic of each individual choreographer. Indeed, identifying movement qualities with the intention of co-relating them to specific meanings and choreographic intentions is practically impossible without taking an artist-driven approach. Moreover, equipping dancers with wearable technology in order to accurately track each of their movements is only applicable in controlled laboratory scenarios, therefore not being a viable approach to analyze large scale real-world rehearsals or performances. This paper describes a visualization system that exposes movement qualities for dance through rendering effects. Combining optical flow analysis with depth video information, we were able to estimate the three-dimensional flow for each point in the cloud. This information was used to color point cloud videos with this information, showing potential to be used for the creation of different rendering effects, which are also discussed in this paper. The data used was captured in a non-intrusive manner during the creation process of a dance piece by Portuguese choreographer Rui Lopes Graça, enabling us to examine nuances and details of the rehearsals' process, which would not be replicable in a laboratory environment.",

In particular,  movies have a  strong emotional  impact  on  us,  with  their  rich multimedia content and their stories; while games tend to defy and engage us facing challenges and hopefully achieving rewarding experiences and results. In this paper, we present a web application being designed and developed to access movies based on emotional impact, with the focus on the emotional annotation of movies, using  different  emotional  representations,  and  gamification  elements  to  further  engage  users  in  this  task, beyond their intrinsic motivation. These annotations can help enriching emotional classification of movies and their impact on users, with machine learning approaches, later helping to find movies based on this impact; and they can also be collected as personal notes like on a journal where users collect the movies they treasure the most, and that they can review and even compare along their journey. We also present a preliminary user evaluation,  allowing  to  assess  and  learn  about  its  perceived  utility,  usability  and  user  experience,  and  to identify most promising features and directions for further improvements and developments.",

abstract={Dance Data, Cognition, and Multimodal Communication is the result of a collaborative and transdisciplinary effort towards a first definition of "dance data", with its complexities and contradictions, in a time where cognitive science is growing in parallel to the need of a renewed awareness of the body’s agency in our manyfold interactions with the world. 
It is a reflection on the observation of bodily movements in artistic settings, and one that views human social interactions, multimodal communication, and cognitive processes through a different lens—that of the close collaboration between performing artists, designers, and scholars. 
This collection focuses simultaneously on methods and technologies for creating, documenting, or representing dance data. The editors highlight works focusing on the dancers’ embodied minds, including research using neural, cognitive, behavioural, and linguistic data in the context of dance composition processes. Each chapter deals with dance data from an interdisciplinary perspective, presenting theoretical and methodological discussions emerging from empirical studies, as well as more experimental ones. 
The book, which includes digital Support Material on the volume's Routledge website, will be of great interest to students and scholars in contemporary dance, neuro-cognitive science, intangible cultural heritage, performing arts, cognitive linguistics, embodiment, design, new media, and creativity studies.},
